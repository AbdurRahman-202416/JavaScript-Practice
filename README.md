# JavaScript Practice

Welcome to my **JavaScript Practice Repository**! This repository contains hands-on examples and exercises to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript concepts. The practices are inspired by the well-regarded *Eloquent JavaScript* book and cover a wide range of fundamental and advanced JavaScript topics.

## ðŸ“š **Topics Covered**

### 1. **Variables**
Understand the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`, and their scoping rules. Learn about their behavior in different contexts.

### 2. **Control Structures**
Explore `if-else`, `switch`, and other control structures to handle decision-making in JavaScript effectively.

### 3. **Functions**
Dive into regular functions and arrow functions, focusing on their `this` behavior and how to leverage them in various scenarios.

### 4. **Asynchronous Programming**
Master `Promises`, `async/await`, and how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations for better performance and cleaner code.

### 5. **DOM Manipulation**
Learn to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) by creating, appending, and modifying HTML elements dynamically.

### 6. **Higher-Order Functions**
Practice with functional programming concepts like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` to manipulate and transform arrays.

### 7. **Error Handling**
Understand how to manage exceptions gracefully using `try...catch` and the importance of cleanup actions with `finally`.

### 8. **Classes and Inheritance**
Learn to create classes and subclasses using `extends` and `super` for object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

### 9. **JavaScript in the Browser**
Explore the `fetch` API to handle HTTP requests and integrate external APIs into web applications.

### 10. **Node.js Basics**
Get familiar with Node.js concepts, including file system operations like reading and writing files.
